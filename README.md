# Sign-upPage

The task is to create a sign-up page with many fields to take inputs from the user, using simple built-in form validation to make sure the correct inputs are given by the user. Rather than following the design given to us in The Odin Project, I have instead used the deisgn for an application I have made seperate to Odin - ColourCurv. I have though used the same input fields and additional features, just not taken the layout given.
This project will be utilizing: HTML forms; form validation; css styling; JS form validation; JS form styling for incorrect values.
